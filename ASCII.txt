List Of Parameters

No. of gaussians for each point = 3 (3 means clustering)
learning rate = 0.01
When mismatched new gaussian parameters
Variance = 35
mixing coefficient = 0.00025

The attached coding file is fully documented. For any doubt you can refer code.
Video files are more than 100 mb. So they are uploaded on drive and link is written given below.


Code automatically generates two video file for background and Foreground.

In the end of the code we have written two for loops for generating background and foreground video files.
You can know the algorithm we have used by simply going through the code.

For 400 frames our code is taking around 4 minutes. As you increase no. of frames time period for processing will increase exponentially.
